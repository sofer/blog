There are a lot of applications available for learning touch typing, but they are not that many good ones.

Requirements:
Being able to see what I have typed
When I mistype something, I want to be able to see what I have typed as I type it, so I can correct the positioning of my hands without looking at my keyboard. This works better if I can see it on the line I am copying from, not on another part of the screen (Out: TIPP10)

Either, being forced to use the back button
Fast error correction is important. Not having to use the back button is not a benefit (although, preventing me typing past the mistyped character might be). This helps me learn how to correct a typo and to return to the correct position on the keyboard to resume typing.

Alternatively, not stopping for errors
Or, I might prefer just to keep typing. This means that typos do not get in the way of measuring speed.

Learning the entire keyboard
Including caps, digits, special characters, the back button (see above) and the return key.

Being able to use my own copy
Particularly so that I can enter blocks of code.

o Decent feedback on typing speed progress
Obviously. Also to take account of different levels, i.e. how many types of keystrokes are being used.

Absence of screen clutter.
