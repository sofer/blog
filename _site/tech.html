	  <p>I have some tables that I am populating from a <span class="caps">CSV</span> file and it took me a little while to work out where to unpack the contents of the file.

	  <p>In any block of code, execution is sequential. Each line of code will not execute until the previous line has executed. If a line contains a function call, then the next line will begin execution after that function returns a value. If the function continues to execute code even after it returns a value, then the code in the original block is no longer executing sequentially, in other words two different blocks of code are running concurrently. Concurrency is generally achieved in software by some implementation of threads.</p>

	</div>    
	<div class='content'>
	  <p>I came across a situation where I thought I wanted to access the <code>current_user</code> from within a model, but it was just a case of mistaken thinking. Making session variables like <code>current_user</code> accessible to a model is a break with convention, and breaking with conventions is usually a bad idea. So, the rule is: don&#8217;t do it unless you have exhausted all other options. There is a probably an easier way of doing what you are trying to do.</p>

	<div class='content'>
	  <p>I have a tendency to multiply layouts in Rails, so that after I have defined the main application layout in <code>/app/views/layouts.application.html.erb</code>, I create different layouts for different controllers as needed. That&#8217;s all OK, except that I find myself cutting and pasting from the application layout which is just wrong, wrong, wrong.</p>

	<div class='content'>
	  <p>Rails offers the <code>html_escape</code> method (usually shortened to <code>h</code>), which prevents simple attempts at code injection. However, when users are entering content onto a site, there is a very good case for sanitizing the input. After all, if a rogue user is injecting unwanted code into my <span class="caps">HTML</span> forms, why would I want to store it in my database? It makes sense to neutralize it before it gets stored.</p>

	  <p>When I save data in Rails, I continually misuse the different methods available, so that my code is sprinkled with <code>save</code>, <code>save!</code>, <code>save(false)</code>, <code>update_attribute</code>, <code>update_attributes</code> and so on.
