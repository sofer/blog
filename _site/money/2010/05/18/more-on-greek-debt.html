      <h1>More on Greek debt</h1>
      <blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the fiscal squeeze of 16pc of <span class="caps">GDP</span> being imposed on Greece&mdash;without off-setting monetary or (internal <span class="caps">EMU</span>) exchange stimulus, and with a further accumulation of debt to 150pc of <span class="caps">GDP</span>&mdash;will lead to a stable Greece. It will destabilize Greek society. It is an evil policy. Greece is suffering the entire burden of adjustment: the banks are being entirely bailed out. Our sympathies should be with the Greek people. It is enough to turn me into a Communist.&#8221;</p>
