      <h1>A quick position statement</h1>
      <h2>Taxes</h2>
<p>Unlike other forms of tax, taxes on the rental value of land and other<br />
natural amenities and also on the extraction of raw materials do no<br />
economic harm. They are also easy to collect, hard to avoid and could<br />
theoretically fund all our public services.</p>
<h2>Intellectual property</h2>
<p>The point of patents and copyrights is to encourage innovation in the<br />
arts and manufacturing, not to provide monopoly profits over and above<br />
the costs of development. The law should reflect that.</p>
<h2>International Trade</h2>
<p>Large and long-lasting balance of payments disequilibria are<br />
destabilising and harmful. A country incapable of supporting itself in<br />
the supply of food and energy is strategically vulnerable. The global<br />
trade of manufactured goods is largely unnecessary and its social<br />
benefits over-stated. The social costs of exposing a national labour<br />
force to competition with cheaper labour overseas is significant.</p>
<h2>International Finance</h2>
<p>Banking should never have been allowed to escape national boundaries.<br />
The unrestricted flow of national currencies across national<br />
boundaries is harmful. The Eurodollar market has been a dangerous<br />
mistake and needs to be closed down.</p>
<h2>Currencies</h2>
<p>The Euro is a mistake and will fail because the Eurozone is too large<br />
and the degree of economic convergence across national boundaries that<br />
it requires is too large. Large currency areas impoverish those<br />
regions unable to support themselves in trade with other areas. Even<br />
within national boundaries, a single currency can impoverish those<br />
parts of a country unable to produce as much value as they consume.<br />
Only large transfer payments make such impoverishment feasible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for now.</p>
