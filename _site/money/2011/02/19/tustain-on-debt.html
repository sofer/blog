      <h1>Tustain on Debt</h1>
      <p>Paul Tustain, founder of BullionVault.com, unsurprisingly thinks that<br />
<a href="http://www.bullionvault.com/GoldWhereToNow/">gold prices are going<br />
up</a>. Even if it&rsquo;s only an<br />
extended sales pitch, his video still makes some interesting points.</p>
<p>First, returns from gold mining are declining, squeezed by the expense<br />
of extraction and the increasing effectiveness of governments in<br />
extracting ecomomic rent from the miners, so that they are no longer a<br />
good leveraged bet on the increase in the value of gold.</p>
<p>Second, taking data from the <span class="caps">BIS</span>, the UK is likely to have debt levels<br />
of over 150% of <span class="caps">GDP</span> by 2020, that is well past the key 90% level<br />
defined by Reinhart and Rogoff as the point beyond which debt crises<br />
become likely.</p>
<p>Third, 2008 and 2009 saw bumper harvests that were statistical<br />
outliers in a trend that is largely flat, while population and<br />
consumption per head continue to rise inexorably. Any downturn in food<br />
production is likely to lead to more price spikes.</p>
<p>Fourth, the apparently healthy maturity profile of UK government debt<br />
is a result almost entirely of quantitive easing being focussed on the<br />
long end of the maturity spectrum (i.e. what Buiter calls qualitative<br />
easing). Almost none of the longer-term government debt is being<br />
bought in the open market. If you strip Bank of England purchases out,<br />
the profile of government debt is pretty unhealthy. Also most of the<br />
private buyers of long-term debt are banks that can borrow short-term<br />
from the Bank of England to finance these purchases. The banks are<br />
making huge profits from this. And as long as the Bank of England<br />
continues to buy long-dated government securities, the banks can<br />
continue to sell back long-dated securities profitably. The Government<br />
has made a profit on its purchase of banks&#8217; equities, which may be<br />
good political PR, but the upshot is yet more debt on the Government&rsquo;s<br />
books and of increasingly short maturities.</p>
<p>Finally, in Weimar Germany, inflation did start with the printing of<br />
money by the government as it attempted to pay for reparations and<br />
their own striking workers in the occupied Ruhr, but what caused it to<br />
turn into hyperinflation was the resultant loss of confidence in the<br />
Mark, which in turn caused private investors to demand more and more<br />
for long term loans, so as people stopped trusting marks, any Marks in<br />
long-term stores were converted into debt with shorter maturities and<br />
eventually to cash and then anything that might hold its value. That&rsquo;s<br />
when the gold price began to rise in terms of Reich Marks. So, long<br />
term money was piling up as short term debt and then into cash and<br />
assets.  In 1923, hyperinflation was preceded by an investment boom as<br />
investors liquidated debt in favour of investment in industrial<br />
capacity. Hyperinflation only really took off after that investment<br />
led to industrial over-capacity.</p>
<p>In 2011, hedge funds are investing in commodities and pension funds<br />
are investing in property. It looks not unlike Germany in 1923. The<br />
upshot could well be severe inflation caused by the melting back of<br />
bonds into cash and real assets.</p>
<p>There are only two choices for government: Slash public spending or default.</p>
