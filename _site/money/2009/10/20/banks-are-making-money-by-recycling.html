      <h1>Banks are making money by recycling</h1>
      <p>Wall Street banks like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have been making money from trading in the last quarter. There has been some uncertainty in the press about what this &#8220;trading&#8221; actually consists of. Some have suggested it refers to stock and commodity trades, others to bets against the dollar, and still others to increased commissions on their clients&#8217; trades. Philip Greenspun has a simpler explanation: they are borrowing money from the U.S. government at 0% to buy short-term government debt at 2-3%. They are being subsidised by the taxpayer for recycling government money.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Because of the Collapse of 2008 financial reforms, the big investment banks are able to borrow money from the U.S. government at 0 percent interest. Then they can turn around and buy short-term bonds that pay 2 or 3 percent annual interest. Now they&#8217;re making 2 percent on whatever they borrowed. They can use leverage to increase this number, by pledging some of the bonds that they&#8217;ve already bought as collateral on additional bonds&#8230;So the money is just being shuffled from one Federal bank account to another, with each Wall Street bank skimming off $1 billion per month for itself&#8221; <sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></p>
