      <h1>The Economist in an upbeat mood</h1>
      <p>This week The Economist has used their front cover to make it clear what they think of any glimmers of hope there might be in the world economy. <em>&#8220;The worst thing for the world economy&#8221;</em>, they say, <em>&#8220;would be to assume the worst is over&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p>They go on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The Depression showed how damaging it can be if governments don&#8217;t step in when the rest of the economy seizes up. Yet action on the current scale has never been tried before and nobody knows when it will have an effect&#8212;let alone how much difference it will make. Whatever the impact, it would be a mistake to confuse the twitches of an economy on life-support with a lasting recovery. A real recovery depends on government demand being supplanted by sustainable sources of private spending. And here the news is almost uniformly grim.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>brightest light</em> for them is in China,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;where a huge inventory adjustment has exaggerated the impact of falling foreign demand, and where the government has the cash and determination to prop up domestic spending. China&#8217;s stimulus is already bearing fruit. Loans are soaring and infrastructure investment is growing smartly. The IMF&#8217;s latest forecast, that China&#8217;s economy will grow by 6.5% this year, may prove conservative.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although they could be <a href="http://www.sofer.com/blog/duncan-on-china.html">dead wrong about that</a>.</p>
