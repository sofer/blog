      <h1>Reviving the housing market</h1>
      <p>When I read over the weekend that Gordon Brown is <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7903985.stm">proposing to put an end to 100% mortgages</a>, it put me in mind of horses bolting through stable doors. Exactly who in command of their senses would now be either requesting or granting a 100% mortgage?</p>
<p>And now I read that <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/bf276e70-011d-11de-8f6e-000077b07658.html">the UK government is going to attempt to revive the housing market through Northern Rock</a>. But that presupposes that lending has stopped because the banks don&#8217;t want to lend rather than because households do not want to borrow.</p>
<p>That may be true now, while would-be house purchasers are still suffering from an overhang of optimism, but I cannot imagine that it will be true for long.</p>
<p>Having begun to read Richard Koo&#8217;s &#8220;The Holy Grail of Macroeconomics&#8221;, it seems pretty clear to me that we are now entering a balance sheet recession, in which businesses and households will be keen to pay down their debt and during which asset prices will continue to fall for some time.</p>
<p>Anyone attempting to buy a house now must be mad. And any politician attempting to revive the housing market is almost certainly being irresponsible. It is unlikely that any householder taking a mortgage out with Northern Rock this month will be thanking Mr. Brown in a year&#8217;s time.</p>
