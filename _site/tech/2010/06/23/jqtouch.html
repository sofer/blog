<h1>Loading jQTouch files</h1>

<p>When adding jQTouch files to a web a page, order matters.</p>
<p>The jQuery itself needs to be loaded first, but it is also important that the <code>$.jQTouch({})</code> intialization happens after the jQuery <code>ready</code> event.</p>
<p>If instead the jQTouch initialization happens before the jQuery <code>ready</code> event is loaded, it appears that event handlers will not be attached to dynamic elements (i.e. those elements that are added after the document has loaded).</p>
<p>The easiest way to ensure that <code>$.jQTouch({})</code> intialization happens last is probably to create a separate file for it and make sure that it gets loaded last.</p>
<p>I have extracted a minimal set of files from the jQTouch distribution. Just enough to get going with, including a <code>jqt-init.js</code> file containing the necessary initialization.</p>
