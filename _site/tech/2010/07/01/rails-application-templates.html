<p>Rails application templates allow me to automate the setup of each new Rails application, so I don&#8217;t have to repeat all the steps required to get an application running the way I want it.</p>
<p>Application templates use <em>Thor</em>, which like <em>rake</em>, <em>ant</em>, <em>make</em> and <em>Capistrano</em>, is a domain-specific language for automating scripting tasks.</p>
<p>On top of the <a href="http://rdoc.info/projects/wycats/thor">standard Thor commands</a>, Rails application templates also provide <a href="http://api.rails.info/classes/Rails/Generators/Actions.html">additional methods</a>.</p>
<p>Using the <code>apply</code> method, several templates can be used inside a single template, making it easy to mix and match different templates for a particular implementations. Files can be loaded remotely, allowing them to be maintained on Github.</p>
<p>I have recently created a template and <a href="http://gist.github.com/460217">uploaded it to github</a>.</p>
