<h1>Accessing current_user from within a model: just don't do it</h1>

<p>I came across a situation where I thought I wanted to access the <code>current_user</code> from within a model, but it was just a case of mistaken thinking. Making session variables like <code>current_user</code> accessible to a model is a break with convention, and breaking with conventions is usually a bad idea. So, the rule is: don&#8217;t do it unless you have exhausted all other options. There is a probably an easier way of doing what you are trying to do.</p>
<p>Here was my situation. I had users logging in to an application and signing up for various groups. The relationship between models was as follows:</p>
<pre>
class Users &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :memberships, :dependent =&gt; :destroy
  has_many :groups, :through =&gt; :memberships
end

class Groups &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :memberships, :dependent =&gt; :destroy
  has_many :users, :through =&gt; :memberships
end

class Memeberships &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :group
end
</pre>
<p>When a user created a new group, I wanted them to be added automatically to the group through a membership table, so at first I did something like this:</p>
<pre>
@group = Group.create(params[:group])
</pre>
<p>But, in doing this, I had already made an elementary mistake. Assuming the <code>current_user</code> is accessible to the controller, something like this would obviously have been better:</p>
<pre>@group = current_user.groups.create(params[:group])</pre>
<p>In other words, if I had written <code>current_user.groups.create</code> instead of just <code>Group.create</code>, the Membership table would have been  updated automatically.</p>
<p>As an alternative, say I wanted to set up the <code>current_user</code> as the owner of the group, I could possibly do this:</p>
<pre>@group = current_user.own_groups.create(params[:group])</pre>
<p>Instead of adding the <code>current_user</code> as a member of the new group, I could make the <code>current_user</code> the owner (i.e. it&#8217;s the current_user&#8217;s &#8216;own group&#8217;). This would also need the following new line in the User model:</p>
<pre>

has_many :own_groups, :through =&gt; :memberships, :class_name =&gt; 'Group', :foreign_key =&gt; 'group_id'</pre>
<p>And in the Group model:</p>
<pre>

has_one :owner, :through =&gt; :memberships, :class_name =&gt; 'User', :foreign_key =&gt; "id"</pre>
<p>However, there is another&#8212;and my preferred&#8212;way of doing this. Rather than have the relationship defined in the Group model as a foreign key, the &#8216;ownership&#8217; of the group can be defined in the Membership model, as a kind of membership.</p>
<p>This keeps the responsibility where it probably belongs, in the relationship (i.e. Membership) model. It also makes it easier to change the definition of &#8216;ownership&#8217; at a future date, so that a group could have more than one &#8216;owner&#8217;. In other words, it&#8217;s a more flexible design.</p>
