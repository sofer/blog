      <h1>Some rules of thumb for building Rails applications</h1>
      <p>A few reminders to myself of how to keep Rails applications simple.</p>
<p>Always start building an application using RESTful scaffold and don&#8217;t add non-RESTful actions to your controller unless you have a very good reason. If you think you need a new action, you are probably missing a relationship model somewhere. See <a href="http://www.sofer.com/blog/keeping-it-restful.html">Keeping it RESTful</a>.</p>
<p>Keep views tidy with intelligent use of layouts. See <a href="http://www.sofer.com/blog/layouts-in-rails.html">Layouts in Rails</a>.</p>
<p>Use named scopes. They are really quite nice. However, be careful of using them with <code>has_many :through</code> relations (See <a href="http://www.sofer.com/blog/named-scopes-and-has-many-through-relations-in-rails.html">Named scopes and has_many :through relations in Rails</a>). It may be easier to create <code>has_many</code> relations with additional conditions (e.g. <code>has_many :responses</code>, <code>has_many :correct_responses</code>, and so on)  than to create named scopes in the join model, even though doing so does break encapsulation between models.</p>
<p>For a complex form representing a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship, use accepts_nested_attributes_for (new in 2.3). See Ryan Daigle&#8217;s <a href="http://ryandaigle.com/articles/2009/2/1/what-s-new-in-edge-rails-nested-attributes">What&#8217;s New in Edge Rails: Nested Object Forms</a>.</p>
<p>For a complex form that defines a many-to-many relationship using checkboxes it might be better want to use <span class="caps">HABTM</span>, but otherwise use <code>has_many :through</code>. Ryan Bates has produced <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/17-habtm-checkboxes">an excellent description of <span class="caps">HABTM</span> checkboxes</a>. It&#8217;s quick an easy to do with <span class="caps">HABTM</span>. but it&#8217;s a pain to do it with a <code>has_many :through</code> relationship.</p>
<p>If a model in the middle of a has_many :through relationship has attributes (other than the two foreign keys), then it is probably worth creating a scaffold for it. To keep controllers RESTful, updates to the relationship and the setting of attributes should probably be made via the join model&#8217;s controller (besides which, if those attributes also use validations then attempts to add records directly to the has_many :through association will probably fail, because the new join record thus created will by default have blank attributes).</p>
<p>Complex joins can be managed with hash-style <code>find</code> operations using the <code>:joins</code> option. See <a href="http://www.sofer.com/blog/using-joins-in-active-record.html">Using :joins in Active Record</a>.</p>
<p>Eager loading can be achieved using the similar hash-style <code>:include</code> option.</p>
