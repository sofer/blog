Hopefully the financial crisis and the recession that has ended only on paper (if that) will provide the opportunity to teach people that there is no such thing as abstract economic forces; instead, there are different groups using the political system to fight for larger shares of society&#8217;s wealth.

	  <p>Wall Street banks like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have been making money from trading in the last quarter.

Philip Greenspun has a simpler explanation: they are borrowing money from the U.S. government at 0% to buy short-term government debt at 2-3%. They are being subsidised by the taxpayer for recycling government money.</p>

However, now that the country faces excess capacity and deflation at home, most new investments (undertaken to expand industrial capacity still further) can only be loss making if targeted at the domestic market. In such an environment, the majority of new loans that are extended within China are destined to become non-performing. If the banks continue to extend credit aggressively, the cost that the government will have to bear to bail out China&#8217;s depositors may quickly exceed fiscal resources.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>&#8220;What are we to conclude about the efficacy of credit creation [between 1933 and 1936] as a means of attaining recovery? All conclusions must necessarily be tentative, but it seems to be clear that the effects have been smaller and slower in appearing than was claimed by the advocates of the theory [that the central bank can stimulate recovery by creating credit]. It seems to require a very great expansion of the base of the structure, continued for a considerable time, before the appearance of an adequate rise in the stream of money, which alone can affect the size of individual incomes.&#8221;</p>

	  <p>The banking system is to all intents and purposes broke. Liabilities almost certainly exceed assets by a significant margin and, but for the recent interventions of central banks, the equity of our major banks would be worthless. There is probably not a single one of them either in London or New York that is solvent.</p>

	  <p>Brad Setser wrote a piece yesterday on the funding of the US budget deficit in which he points out that central banks are not responsible for most of the recent growth in the holdings of US Treasuries&#8212;the US private sector is. Meanwhile, Constantin Gurdgiev  thinks that Treasuries are likely to go belly up later this year when the risk of deflation subsides.</p>

	  <p>Storing a commodity costs money. This cost of carry tends to exert a gentle upward pressure on the current prices for future delivery of that commodity. This can produce what is described as a normal or upward sloping yield curve. A futures market in this state is said to be in contango.</p>

	  <p>The futures market for oil is currently in contango. In other words, the price of oil for delivery in several months&#8217; time is higher than the cost of oil for delivery now. There is currently such a wide gap that traders with deep enough pockets can lease a tanker, fill it with oil bought on the spot market, sell a contract to deliver it later in the year, and realise a pretty significant and moderately risk-free return (assuming that their tanker doesn&#8217;t get boarded by pirates).</p>

	  <p>Geoffrey Crowther wrote about the Great Depression in the final chapter of his book <cite>An Outline of Money</cite> . Despite being written in the 1940&#8217;s, what he had to say has more relevance to the current economic crisis than anything else I have read on the subject.*</p>
