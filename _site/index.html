    <p>I have some tables that I am populating from a <span class="caps">CSV</span> file and it took me a little while to work out where to unpack the contents of the file. In the end, it was obvious that the place for it was in the model. In realising this I had the epiphany (again!) that controllers should really be kept very, very simple.</p>

    <p class="quote">&#8220;when looking at economic phenomena, be they the financial crisis or the vast increase in inequality of the past thirty years, it&#8217;s politics that matters, not just abstract economic forces. One of the singular victories of the rich has been convincing the rest of us that their disproportionate success has been due to abstract economic forces beyond anyone&#8217;s control (technology, globalization, etc.), not old-fashioned power politics. Hopefully the financial crisis and the recession that has ended only on paper (if that) will provide the opportunity to teach people that there is no such thing as abstract economic forces; instead, there are different groups using the political system to fight for larger shares of society&#8217;s wealth. And one group has been winning for over thirty years.&#8221;</p>

    <p>In any block of code, execution is sequential. Each line of code will not execute until the previous line has executed. If a line contains a function call, then the next line will begin execution after that function returns a value. If the function continues to execute code even after it returns a value, then the code in the original block is no longer executing sequentially, in other words two different blocks of code are running concurrently. Concurrency is generally achieved in software by some implementation of threads.</p>

They can do this without fear of insolvency and bank runs because of explicit and implicit government guarantees. Banks are state-sponsored oligopolies that could not exist without tax-payer subsidy. They should not exist. Fractional reserve banking is not capitalism, it is theft. We should put an end to fractional reserve banking now.</p>

However, now that the country faces excess capacity and deflation at home, most new investments (undertaken to expand industrial capacity still further) can only be loss making if targeted at the domestic market. In such an environment, the majority of new loans that are extended within China are destined to become non-performing. If the banks continue to extend credit aggressively, the cost that the government will have to bear to bail out China&#8217;s depositors may quickly exceed fiscal resources.&#8221;</em></p>

    <p>1) The primary cause of this crisis has been the recycling into international markets of the huge quantities of credit built up by the major exporting nations far in excess of what could sensibly be used in productive investments. In other words, trade imbalances are the source of our misery. subprime mortgages, credit derivatives, excessive credit card debts, insufficient regulation, greed and fraud are just the channels through which the consequences of these unsustainable imbalances flowed.</p>

    <p>What are we to conclude about the efficacy of credit creation [between 1933 and 1936] as a means of attaining recovery? All conclusions must necessarily be tentative, but it seems to be clear that the effects have been smaller and slower in appearing than was claimed by the advocates of the theory [that the central bank can stimulate recovery by creating credit]. It seems to require a very great expansion of the base of the structure, continued for a considerable time, before the appearance of an adequate rise in the stream of money, which alone can affect the size of individual incomes.</p>
