<p>I have just put <a href="http://www.repeatcode.com/">RepeatCode</a> into &#8220;pre-beta&#8221;. there is very little material up so far, but I have now removed the login barrier, so if anyone happens to wander onto the site, they can actually try out some A-level maths or a bit of French.</p>
<p>I still have a rather long coding task list and I have barely started on the learning materials, but at least there is something in place now.</p>
