<p>According to Avi Bryant (speaking in 2009), <a href="http://python.mirocommunity.org/video/1186/djangocon-2009-django-is-obsol">web frameworks are
obsolete</a>.</p>

<p>His argument is that, with the creation of the V8 JavaScript virtual
machine, sophisticated web apps can now be written in JavaScript
almost entirely on the client side, communicating via JSON to the
server. As a result, templates will die. It will make more sense to
generate HTML with programmatic APIs, written in JavaScript. And if
you don&rsquo;t like JavaScript, you can use a <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS">language that compiles to
JavaScript</a>
instead. But we do not need to go back to a two-tier model, i.e. just
javascript accessing remote data, we can still separate out the
presentation and the application logic, it&rsquo;s just that this is
increasingly going to happen on the client side.</p>
