As "David Kaneda explains":http://blog.jqtouch.com/post/205113875/milliseconds-responsiveness-and-the-fast-tap in the jQTouch blog, he introduced a @tap@ custom event to remove a 300ms delay when tapping on a link in Mobile Safari.

On other browser platforms, a @tap@ event will be interpreted as a @click@, so I can use it when I want to respond to both types of events in different browsers.

However, @tap@ is intended for use with links, i.e. with an anchor tag (@<a href...@). It will not respond appropriately to a tap on a part of the screen that is not a link. In that case I should use @click@ instead. this will work whatever platform I am using&mdash;as long as I am not clicking on a link.

So, to get the desired cross-platform behaviour for mobile apps, use the @tap@ event for links and @click@ otherwise.
