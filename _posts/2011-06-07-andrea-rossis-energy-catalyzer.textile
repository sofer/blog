bq. The new tests with the energy catalyzer, which seems to generate heat by an unknown nuclear reaction, took place in Bologna on 19 and 28 April, 2011.

bq. As in previous tests the objective was to measure the net energy that the device generates as accurately as possible.

bq. The results of the two tests showed a developed net power of between 2.3 and 2.6 kilowatts &ndash; of the order of a large stove plate. Input electric power was in the order of 300 watts.
