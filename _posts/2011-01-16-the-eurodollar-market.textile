bq. "Eurodollar deposits are a cheaper source of funds because they are free of reserve requirements and deposit insurance assessments. Due to the secrecy and light regulation surrounding the Eurodollar market, based in London, an extraordinary situation has unfolded where the Euromarket which has no physical embodiment in an exchange is now the largest source of capital in the world."
