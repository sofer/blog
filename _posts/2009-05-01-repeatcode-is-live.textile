I have just put "RepeatCode":http://www.repeatcode.com/ into "pre-beta". there is very little material up so far, but I have now removed the login barrier, so if anyone happens to wander onto the site, they can actually try out some A-level maths or a bit of French. 

I still have a rather long coding task list and I have barely started on the learning materials, but at least there is something in place now.
