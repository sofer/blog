title: More on Greek debt
category: money
standfirst: p(quote). "I don’t think the fiscal squeeze of 16pc of GDP being imposed on Greece&mdash;without off-setting monetary or (internal EMU) exchange stimulus, and with a further accumulation of debt to 150pc of GDP&mdash;will lead to a stable Greece. It will destabilize Greek society. It is an evil policy. Greece is suffering the entire burden of adjustment: the banks are being entirely bailed out. Our sympathies should be with the Greek people. It is enough to turn me into a Communist."

A comment left by Ambrose Evans-Pritchard on his own blog entry, "Congress blocks indiscriminate IMF aid for Europe":http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/ambroseevans-pritchard/100005734/congress-blocks-indiscriminate-imf-aid-for-europe/.

(Ambrose Evans-Pritchard is about as unlikely a communist as I can imagine)
