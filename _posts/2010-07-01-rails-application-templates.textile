Rails application templates allow me to automate the setup of each new Rails application, so I don't have to repeat all the steps required to get an application running the way I want it.

Application templates use _Thor_, which like _rake_, _ant_, _make_ and _Capistrano_, is a domain-specific language for automating scripting tasks.

On top of the "standard Thor commands":http://rdoc.info/projects/wycats/thor, Rails application templates also provide "additional methods":http://api.rails.info/classes/Rails/Generators/Actions.html.

Using the @apply@ method, several templates can be used inside a single template, making it easy to mix and match different templates for a particular implementations. Files can be loaded remotely, allowing them to be maintained on Github.

I have recently created a template and "uploaded it to github":http://gist.github.com/460217.
